            <h3>Anti-malairal Drug Discovery</h3>
            <div class="research-div">
                <img src="/ARNISH_SCHEMATIC DIAGRAM.jpg"/>
                <p>Currently we have focused on two pathways in malaria parasite to design antimalarial agents; Intracellular signaling molecules such as protein kinases and Proteases. We have screened heterocyclic compound library, drug library, plant phytochemicals and molecules designed using ligand-based approach, to identify potent antimalarial agents (Eur Food Res Technol, 234: 905-911, Curr Drug Discov Technol, 10, 85-91, Med Chem Res, 22; 4737-4744, Eur J Med Chem, 70, 607-612.). The best molecules from the search are found to exhibit anti-malarial activity against plasmodium falciparum 3D7. Now we are taking these molecules and checking their activity in mice and other animal models. In addition, these molecules are serving as the first line of molecules to design potent anti-malarial agents.</p>

            <h3>Regulation of Innate Immune Response</h3>
            <div class="research-div">
                <img src="/CD 36 Model.jpg"/>
                <p>Phagocytic cells such as monocytes,macrophages and neutrophils plays a crucial role in innate immune response and all are involved in phagocytosis of IRBCs. Macrophage  often use pattern recognition receptors, including Scavenger receptor to recognize as well as phagocytose invading microbes. Out of them CD36,plays a pivotal role in non-opsonic phagocytosis of P.falciparum infected RBCs. Here our current focus is to understand the crucial signaling mechanism behind CD36 desregulation and its impact on cytokine secretion during malaria.</p>

            <h3>Designing immunostimulatory and Anticancer agents.</h3>
            <div class="research-div">
                <img src="PKC project.png"/>
                <p>Protein kinase C is a family of serine/threonine kinases that plays a central role in cellular signal transduction in mammalian physiology such as growth, differentiation, tumor promotion and apoptosis. Diacylglycerols(DAGs) serve as endogenous ligands in healthy cells. The PKC isozymes have important roles in tumor biology. Elevated levels of PKC are seen in proliferative cancer cells compared to healthy cells like immune cells. Recent studies suggest that PKC signaling is crucial for immune-activation of neutrophils and lymphocytes.
                    Our goal is to discover new lead molecules for a new generation of chemotherapeutic drugs that act via activation of PKC isozymes in healthy immune cells leading their activation to induce proper immune response. In addition, these molecules may activate PKC in cancer cells leading to their apoptosis. Also we would want to have a picture of the various possible apoptotic signaling pathways activated by such agonist molecules by interaction with their respective PKC isozymes in cancer cells.</p>
